## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is where I learned how to use SCSS for styling. I must say that I enjoyed the learning process. It made my work more organised compared to the way it used to be. Making the website responsive was easy due to the feature that Sass has to write functions and declare variables that can be used everywhere in the code. I am not yet totally good with this, but I know I will with time.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more and master SCSS with time, I think I will learn reactjs and I cant wait.

### Useful resources
